So this is a simple blog post ay? All done from command line and posted to my very own github page, what lolz<br>
Have to say it was pretty easy to set up, after looking at some Python based UI Libraries today (Im looking at you Clutter) <br>
Ruby was a refreshing and safe comfort net, which isnt entirely a good thing. May be to much magic for my own good.
