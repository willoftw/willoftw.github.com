So I started picking up some Python just to give myself a refresher, the last time I used it was about 2002... so stick with me here. <br>
<br>
Watched this video: <br>

<br>
While I really liked some of his points, I have to admit that he hasn't swayed me to python.<br>
He started off by saying Python is convoluted by hard to understand modules that all do the same things, and its hard to find the one you want.<br>
Then he goes on to make another one which is simpler (it handles HTTP requests, he does a good job of explaining it).<br>
And in the end, he has a much simpler python module to do what he wants. But surely isn't that making his first issue worse? Hes adding another python module to a pool of python modules that people are going to struggle to understand, surely to make the module system better a collection of standard packages.<br>
But I guess thats the point of open source, floating ideas out there and the best module will float to the top? <br> In my experience that isn't always the case.

<br>
"So?" I hear you yodel "Dont just moan suggest a better way of doing it!". <br>
Okay fine you asked for it, Pythons package management system needs mature time, pip seems to have been bolted on at around python 3.3 (2012) a whole year after pips 1.0 release and the repositories have only just now started to be helpful (some wild examples have appeared!). <br>
So any Python users and aficionados reading, like your language, dont like your package management system nor your environment isolation system virtualenv but thats another post. Maybe 2016 will be the year of python for me, who knows.
